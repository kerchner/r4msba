# The grammar of graphics

Data visualization is about converting variable values associated with data points, or observations, into visual elements. We often refer to that conversion as *mapping* values to visual features which we call *aesthetics*.

Let's say we have a data set (the `gapminder` data set, in this case), where for each country, we have its population, the continent it's on, mean life expectancy, and GDP (gross domestic product) per capita.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(gapminder)
head(gapminder::gapminder %>% filter(year == 2007))
```

We might opt to map variables as follows:

| Variable        | Aesthetic  |
|-----------------|------------|
| population      | size       |
| continent       | color      |
| life expectancy | y position |
| GDP             | x position |

Of course, the aesthetic elements that are available will depend on the particular style of plot.

# The ggplot2 library

`ggplot2` is a library (within `tidyverse`) that implements this notion of aesthetic mappings.

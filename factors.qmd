A data variable can either be *continuous* or *categorical*. Continuous variables can take on any value within a range, while categorical variables can only take on a limited number of values.

Let's look for a moment at different types and subtypes of variables that we might have:

Let's focus for a moment on Categorical data. Categorical data might have values that are either text or numeric:

- Text variables representing categorical data could look like:
   - `'control'`, `'treatment'`
   - `'red'`, `'blue'`, `'green'`
   - `'good'`, `'better'`, `'best'`

- Numbers can also be used to represent categories:
   - `0`, `1` (e.g. for control and treatment)
   - `1`, `4`, `2` (e.g. for red, blue, green)
   - `1`, `2`, `3` (e.g. for good, better, best)

In R, categorical variables are called *factors*. Factors can be either *ordered* or *unordered*.  So `'control'`, `'treatment'` would be an unordered factor, while `'good'`, `'better'`, `'best'` would be an ordered factor.

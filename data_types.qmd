# Basic data types

TBD

# Vectors

A vector is an ordered collection of data values that are all the same data type.

We can use the `c()` ("combine") function in R to combine a sequence of values into a vector. For example:

```{r}
vector1 <- c(5, 5, 9)
vector1
```

By default, the index of each item is its numbered position (i.e.). But if we want, we can also label each position as well:

```{r}
vector2 <- c(a = 5, b = 5, c = 9)
vector2
```

Remember that vectors contain values that are *all the same type*. What happens if we try to combine differently-typed values into a vector using `c()`?

# Matrices

A matrix is a 2-dimensional structure that contains data that are all the same data type.

We can use the `matrix()` function in R to create a matrix from a sequence of values. For example:

```{r}
matrix1 <- matrix(c(5, 5, 9, 7, NA, 3), nrow = 3, ncol = 2)
matrix1
```

# Lists

It also works well with Python.\nNotebooks such as Jupyter (for example, running with Anaconda) or Google Colab\nDataSpell Free for students, teachers, and community, but not for others.\nOther software development apps such as VSCode\n\nYou can also use a web-based R environment. Choices include:\n\nposit.cloud. There are limitations with the free version; you can pay more for more projects, more space, more computing power, etc.\nIf you (or your institution/orgainzation) has a web server, you can install RStudio Server and access it through the web browser. You would then only be limited by the size of the server it’s running on.\n\nIf you’re aware of other good options, please let me know!",
